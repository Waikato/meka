/**
 *  MultiTargetClassifier.java - A Multi-target Classifier.
 *  To implement this interface, it is also necessary to extend MultilabelClassifier.
 *  Implementing this interface only signals to the Evaluator that we are dealing with multi-target data, 
 *  and a different evaluation output is made. Training and classification is the same, using the 
 *  methods <i>buildClassifier(Instances)</i> and <i>distributionForInstance(Instance)</i>, except that
 *  the latter may return a vector of L*2 doubles instead of L. The extra values are probabalistic 
 *  information (i.e., the probability of class y[j] for the jth target is y[j*2]) that may be used by 
 *  ensemble classifiers.
