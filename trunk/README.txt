Release Notes, Version 1.7.8
----------------------------

Improvements since the last version are os follows:

	* Evaluation output is improved
   
		Evaluation output has been improved, as much in the code, as the visual text output. 
		Basically, objects like doubles[] can be stored, rather than just Strings and Doubles.
		The improvement is overall, but in particular noticeable improvements to cross validation and incremental validation.
		Incremental validation now also displays per-window metrics in the GUI in addition to those of the final window.
