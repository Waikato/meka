RELEASE
=======

The release making process is a two-stage process:

1. Deploy artifacts to Maven Central
2. Create release archive

Prerequisites
-------------

- You need a Sonatype account, which you can create here:
- The Sonatype user needs to be added to the MEKA project, just open the
  following ticket again and specify the user that needs adding:
  https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-9969
- Artifacts get signed using GPG, so you need to have a GPG key and deploy it
  - Create a GPG key
    http://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/
  - Set up Maven (pom.xml and your Maven profile)
    http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html#gpg-signed-components


Deploying artifacts
-------------------

- Ensure all changes have been committed and all tests succeed
- run the following command (and accept or change the version numbers):
  mvn release:prepare release:perform
- log into sonatype
  https://oss.sonatype.org/
- select the *Staging repositories*
- scroll down and check the *netsfmeka* repository
- check deployed artifacts on the *Content* tab (bottom of the screen) using the
  *Archive Browser* once a jar has been selected
- *Close* the repository (top of the screen) with a message like *new release X.Y.Z*
- artifacts will get prepared for being release, which will take some time, keep
  clicking on *Refresh* till the *Release* action is available and *Close* is disabled
- *Release* the repository with a message like *new release X.Y.Z*
- The artifacts will get transferred to Maven Central in the background, should happen
  within 15min. You can check the following URL whether they have been pushed out:
  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/meka/meka/
- The artifacts might not be searchable through http://search.maven.org/ for a few
  hours, as the search index only gets updated every 3 hours or so
- log out of sonatype


Troubleshooting
---------------

- In case artifacts shouldn't get deployed for some reason (give it a few hours), go
  to the following URL and open a ticket:
  https://issues.sonatype.org/


Release archive
---------------

- once the artifacts have been deployed successfully and are available from
  Maven Central, you can create a release archive
- update the version in the "release.xml" file to match the version of the just
  released Meka artifacts (also remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix) and commit changes
- run the following command to create the release archive in the "target" directory:
  mvn -f release.xml clean install
- update the version in the "release.xml" to the new "-SNAPSHOT" version of the
  "pom.xml" file and commit changes
