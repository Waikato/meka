RELEASE
=======

The release making process is a two-stage process:

1. Deploy artifacts to Maven Central
2. Create release archive

Deploying artifacts
-------------------

- Ensure all changes have been committed and all tests succeed
- run the following command (and accept or change the version numbers):
  mvn release:prepare release:perform


Release archive
---------------

- update the version in the "release.xml" file to match the version of the just
  released Meka artifacts (also remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix) and commit changes
- run the following command to create the release archive in the "target" directory:
  mvn -f release.xml clean install
- update the version in the "release.xml" to the new "-SNAPSHOT" version of the
  "pom.xml" file and commit changes
